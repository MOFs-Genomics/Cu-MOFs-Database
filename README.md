## Welcome to Cu-MOFs Database!

You can find solvent-free and disorder-free structure files of most experimental MOFs published on literature here. Specially, MOFs reported without the atomic coordinate files are constructed following the structure information provided in the corresponding synthetic studies.
All the [structure file](https://github.com/Cu-MOFs/tttt/) are solvent-free and disorder-free, being suitable for direct use as input files in simulations.
